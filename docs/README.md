# Quorrae
## What we are
We are a simple lab attempting to do what we do, create a lofty project.
In this respect, we thought what loftier goal than making new consciousness.
So we ventured forth. Where to begin, though?

Consciousness needs a working memory. Got it, a ring buffer.
    Check.
Ring buffers work fine.

Okay, interbody communication. This is a loft task in and of itself.
The brain needs all of the bodily information just to make informed decisions.
This means we need a `brainstem` to facilitate communication. 
    Check.

Next, we need something for vision. Visual cortex, thalamus, and brainstem all linked.
Now to use `V4L2` for device management.

## Test it yourself
Not all demos and tests will be present or fully functioning. This is an ongoing project.

`git clone git@github.com:CrestlessForge/quorrae.git`  
`cd quorrae`  
`cmake -S . -B build`  
`cmake --build build`  
check build for all executables.
